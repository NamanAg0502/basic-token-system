# Basic Token System
- Install the Ethereum wallet and browser extension MetaMask (https://metamask.io/).
- Connect MetaMask to a test network, such as Rinkeby (https://www.rinkeby.io/).
- Obtain some test Ether by following the instructions on the Rinkeby website.
- Go to the Remix online Solidity compiler and debugger (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- In Remix, create a new file and copy the contract code into it. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g. Token.sol).
- In the "Compile" tab, select the Token.sol file and click the "Compile" button.
- In the "Run" tab, select the "Injected Web3" environment and your test network.
- Click the "Create" button to deploy the contract to the test network.
- Follow the prompts in MetaMask to confirm the contract deployment transaction.
- Once the transaction is mined
