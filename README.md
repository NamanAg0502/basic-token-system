# Basic Token System
- We will use metamask as Ethereum wallet(as it is pretty much standard)
- Connect MetaMask to a test network, such as Goerli and add some ether from one of the many faucet.
- Go to (https://remix.ethereum.org/) and create a new file name Token.sol.
- Copy Paste the code from above file.
- In the "Compile" tab, select the Token.sol file and click the "Compile" button.
- In the "Run" tab, select the "Injected Provider - Metamask" environment and your test network.
- Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract to the test network after putting values asked(name, symbol, owner ...).
- Contract will deploy and will be shown in Deployed Contract section below.
